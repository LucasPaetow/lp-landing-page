        <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
        <p>
          Cookies are small pieces of data stored in text files that are saved
          on your computer or other devices when websites are loaded in a
          browser. They are widely used to remember you and your preferences,
          either for a single visit (through a &quot;session cookie&quot;) or
          for multiple repeat visits (using a &quot;persistent cookie&quot;).
        </p>
        <p>
          Session cookies are temporary cookies that are used during the course
          of your visit to the Website, and they expire when you close the web
          browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          Persistent cookies are used to remember your preferences within our
          Website and remain on your desktop or mobile device even after you
          close your browser or restart your computer. They ensure a consistent
          and efficient experience for you while visiting our Website or using
          our Services.
