## About The Project

- A portfolio website should be clean, elegant, not distracting and somehow "wow" the visitor. In my opinion, it cant be done without compromises and I didn't want that.

So here is a Landing Page, where there is no limit to the "wow"

## What I learned from it

- I heavily relied on bright colors/gradients and scroll animations after learning about the brilliant combination of `position: sticky`and percentage-based scroll listeners
